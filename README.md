Lung cancer is one of the diseases with the highest mortality rate. The most promis- ing way to enhance the survival rate of patients is early detection of cancer. The accurate diagnosis of pathological tumor type of lung cancer is significant for early detection and corresponding treatment. An important and most common criteria for determining tumor type is via computed tomography (CT) data. Traditionally, only radiologists are able to read and interpret the CT scan and provide a diagnosis. However, a qualified radiologist is usually required to complete over 10-years train- ing and schooling. In this paper, we use lung cancer dataset from the Iraq-Oncology teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH/NCCD) for im- age classification on 3 different convoluted neural networks (CNNs) to determine the tumor type. The methods we used are VGG-16, ResNet-50 and 101, and Vision Transformer (ViT). The highest accuracy we got is 100.00% from ViT. To improve the model performance, we used the curriculum learning, a training technique that trains machine learning models from easier data to harder data, to pre-organized our dataset and then feed the model. We try curriculum learning on ResNet-50 and 101 models, and the test accuracy increased about at least 5%.
